## My process

### Built with

- Chart.js
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had never used chart.js before, but I was able to look into the documentation and figure out all of the customization I needed. It was incredibly fulfilling to puzzle through.

I also needed to brush up on my async/await functions to successfully pull in the JSON data file, because the chart was loading before the data was parsed.

### Continued development

I want to do a few tutorials and projects using chart JS to make some other tools with real-world application.

### Useful resources

- [CHart.js Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - It took a little digging, but I was able to get what I needed from this.
